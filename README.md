#Usage:

##Scrapers:
###MatchScraper() object - scraper for gosugamers match pages (i.e. http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/gosubet)
Scraper for gosugamers matches. Scrapers for games:  
**CsGoMatchScraper** : Counter-Strike: Global offensive match scraper  
**Dota2MatchScraper** : Dota2 match scraper  
**LolMatchScraperr** : League Of Legends match scraper  
**HearthStoneMatchScraper** : Hearthstone match scraper  
**HotsMatchScraperr** : Heroes of the Storm match scraper

Use those to scrape games for matches. All of the scraper objects have these methods that you should use to retrieve results:   
**find\_live\_matches()** - retrieves a list of Match objects of live games.  
**find\_recent\_matches()** - retrieves a list of Match objects of recent games.   
**find\_upcoming\_matches()** - retrieves a list of Match objects of upcoming games.  

**FAQ:**  
Is it possible to retrieve the whole history of matches displayed on gosugamers?  
-Currently the function for that is not available because it would require some asyncronious request system (extra dependancies etc.) though feel free to open an issue or poke me regaring it.  
Is it possible to retrieve Matchticker part of the website?  
-Yes and No. Gosugamer Matchticker is just upcoming games section from the matches page so you can retrieve the same info by `find_live_matches()` and `find_upcoming_matches()`.  

###Match() object - it's a storage object for match data.  
**game** -  game name (i.e. 'dota2').  
**team1** - first team's name (one on the left).  
**team1\_score** - first team's score (if exists).  
**team1\_bet** - first team's bet percentage.  
**team2** -  second team's name (one on the right).  
**team2\_score** - second team's score (if exists).  
**team2\_bet** - second teams bet percentage.  
**live\_in** - live in, unparsed string that is displayed on the webpage (if exists).
**tournament** - tournament name (if exists).
**has\_vods** - True if vods exists otherwise False.  
**match\_id** - Match id used by gosugamers.  
**match\_url** - Direct url to the match page.  

functions:  
**get\_streams()** - returns a list of stream urls found on the match page.
**__dict__()** - returns all data in formatted dict format for easy json output.
